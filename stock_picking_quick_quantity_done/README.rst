This module allows you to quickly indicate the done quantities in pickings.
This is useful for activities (such as grocery stores) where product stock
quantities are not well updated, due to lack of time for example.
This is the same objective as the legacy function "Force availability".

Usage
=====

This module checks if some "quantities done" in the picking are not equals to
initials demands. If so, "Force availability" button is possible.
User can also set "quantity done" for each line of the picking.
