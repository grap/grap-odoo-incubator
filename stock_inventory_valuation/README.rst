This module add simple valuation on stock inventories, based on standard_price
of each product.

A new computed field ``valuation`` is added on ``stock.inventory`` and
``stock.iventory.line`` models so as to be able to calculate the total
valuation of one inventory.

This module can be usefull when you don't use valuation by quants.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

the field ``valuation`` on ``stock.inventory.line`` is not designed
correctly for the time being : It is a computed field, and should be a
classical field with onchange. It is due to the dual API in odoo 8.0.
When porting this module in version 10.0, should be refactored in normal
field.
