This module extend the Odoo account module, regarding fiscal position.

By default, it is only possible to realize such tax mapping :

* Tax Excl --> Tax Excl / No tax
* Tax Incl --> Tax Excl / No tax

This module allows to realize such mapping and fixes incorrect computation.

* Tax Excl --> Tax Incl
* Tax Incl --> Tax Incl

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

I'm not very confortable to have such patch in an external module.

* When migrating to V16, check if this module is still necessary, or
  open an issue.
