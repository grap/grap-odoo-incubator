This module extends the functionality of stock and account module
to allow non accountant user to declare the use of stockable products for
specific uses (eg: gifts, tastings, etc.)

Configuration

* optionnaly, define accounting settings, if you want to generate accounting
  move, once the internal use is confirmed.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

If the user use a product without an expense account, it can confirm the
internal use, and so, generate stock move, but the generation of the
accounting move will be blocked.

We could imagine to introduce a field account_id, with a on_change, as
any accounting object. (invoice, move, etc.)
