This module extends the functionality of point of sale and to support
improved control during the close of the session.

* Allow user to control each statement. (not only the cash statement,
  by default)

* User should set the closing balance for all the statements

* User could quickly solve control differences (we can an absolute limit),
  thanks to a choosen product configured in POS config.
  This functionnality uses cash.box.out/in methods.

* User can access to the summary by payment methods for each statement

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quentinDupont/grap-odoo-incubator/8.0_ADD_pos_multiple_control_automatic_solve/pos_multiple_control/static/description/account_bank_statement_summary_form.png

* So that, force user to have correct balance on each statement. If not,
  user should have to set Profit or Loss reason, using the OCA module
  ``pos_cash_move_reason``

* As the check is more complete, allow user to reopen a new session, if the
  first one is in a closing state.

Extra checks are done, to prevent user errors:

* It is not possible to click on the button 'Close Session' if there are some
  draft orders.
