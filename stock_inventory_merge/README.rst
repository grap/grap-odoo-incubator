This module extends the functionality of Stock Module to support the
possibility to create many little inventories to merge, and then, to generate
a complete inventory in Odoo.

This module is usefull in a context when you have a lot of products, and you
will physicaly organize your inventory process, making a lot of partial
inventory.

In that case, with this module, the classical process is :

* Make a lot of partial inventories;
* Merge all the partial inventories into a single one;
* Check if there are duplicates and fix the situation. (change a line, or sum
  the lines because a product can be in many places.)
* Fill your inventory with all the products you didn't inventoried with
  a zero quantity.

**Main Features**

* Disable the constrains that makes impossible to have two pending inventories
  with the same product.

* So, a new smart button is available to see the duplicates, into an pending
  inventory, and a button allow users to merge duplicates. In that case,
  the quantities will be sumed.

* Add an action to have the possibility to merge many inventories.
  that wizard will create a new inventories, based on the little ones.

* An option is available to fill an inventory with the missing products that
  are not listed in the inventory lines.
